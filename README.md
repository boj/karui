# Karui (Lightweight in Japanese)

I really don't like using frameworks anymore, or at least frameworks that force you to do certain things.  I actually don't like this framework much either, because it requires you to conform to a basic directory structure.  I suppose I'll change that eventually.

I wrote this because I needed something fast (not a lot of function calls), and allows me to drop in whatever I want in regards to databases, templates, etc.  It also needed to follow the standard design practices most people are familiar with in regards to a typical MVC setup, so when unrelated people to my project look at my code they can quickly navigate and figure it out.
